"""Working indicator behavior when background shells outlive a turn.

A claude-native turn can settle to ``idle`` while background shells keep
running. The forwarder reports that as ``external_session_status: idle``
carrying a positive ``background_task_count``, and the web chat must keep
the working indicator lit — labelled ``"N background tasks still
running"`` — instead of falling idle like the TUI's "N shells still
running" banner.

Both tests drive the real status edges through the Sessions events route
(the same path the claude-native forwarder posts to), so they are
deterministic — no live LLM turn, whose timing and the openai-agents
executor's handling of a blocked mock would make the assertions flaky.
A new turn is represented by its ``running`` status edge (what a composer
send produces); the per-edge background-tally bookkeeping that send() does
locally is covered by the chatStore unit tests.
