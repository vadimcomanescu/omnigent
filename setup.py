"""Custom setuptools build for omnigent.

Generates ``omnigent/_build_info.py`` at wheel build time so the
CLI's update-check (``omnigent/update_check.py``) can tell the user
when their installed build is stale without having to consult
``git`` or hit a remote endpoint at startup.

All other build configuration lives in ``pyproject.toml``; this
file exists solely to register the cmdclass override that runs the
generator before ``build_py`` copies sources into the wheel.

The generated file is gitignored — it is recreated on every build
and only meaningful at install time, where it travels inside the
wheel alongside the rest of the package.

        symlinks into the built wheel — a directory symlink is not walked.
        A plain ``pip install`` / ``uv tool install`` would then ship a

        an installed wheel. Editable installs (``uv sync``) resolve the

        The server mounts that directory at ``/`` when present
        (``omnigent/server/app.py``); when absent it serves an
        API-only JSON landing page and the web UI is unreachable.
        The bundle is npm-build output, not tracked in git, so a
        plain ``pip install .`` / ``uv tool install`` from a checkout
        would otherwise ship no UI — the single most common "the web
        UI doesn't load" report.

        Build policy, chosen to fix that case without slowing the
        backend-only dev loop or breaking node-less CI:

        - Skip if ``web/`` is absent (sdists that don't vendor it).
        - Skip if ``OMNIGENT_SKIP_WEB_UI=true``. The hardened CI
          runners ship a system ``npm`` but have no fast registry
          mirror configured for the lint/test shards, so ``npm
          install`` crawls against the public registry and hits the
          600s timeout — 10 wasted minutes per ``uv sync`` for a
          bundle those jobs never serve. They set this env var to opt
          out.
        - Skip if the bundle already exists, UNLESS
          ``OMNIGENT_BUILD_WEB_UI=1`` forces a rebuild. This keeps
          repeat ``uv sync`` fast for backend devs (build once, reuse)
          while letting release builds force a fresh bundle.
        - Otherwise the build MUST succeed: a missing ``npm`` or a
          failing ``npm install`` / ``npm run build`` aborts the
          install with an actionable error. Omnigent needs Node +
          npm at runtime anyway (the Claude / Codex / Pi harness
          CLIs are npm packages), so a node-less machine would get a
          broken install either way — failing here, with a message
          that says how to fix it, beats a silent API-only install
          that surfaces later as "the web UI doesn't load".

        :raises SystemExit: If ``npm`` is not on PATH or the web UI
            build fails, and no skip condition applies.
